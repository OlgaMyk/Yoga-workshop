Hello girs!
Here we can put our ideas and use one of the world's best tool for project and soft management - GitHub. Let's start! :)

As we discussed our project is going to be 'Yoga Workshop!'. Little more details:
// Presentation should last a maximum of 10 minutes and include:
// 1. project definition
// 2. project team - roles and skills
// 3. project plan with tasks and owners
// 4. project budget
// 5. risks analysis
// 6. identification of stakeholders and possible changes
// 7. plan for monitoring progress and quality
// Presentation can be prepared in ppt or any other tool. Please add some evidence of performing at least part of the work virtually.
